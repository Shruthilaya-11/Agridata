AgriData Explorer: Understanding Indian agriculture with EDA
AgriData Explorer is a data analysis and visualization project focused on exploring India's agricultural performance across states and districts. The project addresses the challenge of fragmented and complex agricultural datasets by cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing key metrics such as crop production, yield, and cultivated area.
It combines Python,SQL, and Power BI to deliver interactive dashboards and analytical insights that serve farmers, policymakers, and researchers.
